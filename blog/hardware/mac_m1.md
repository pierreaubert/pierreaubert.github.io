## macOS 11.2 fix most of my issues but not all (2021-02-10)
 The mac mini is still slow and it make it impossible to use with Reaper and a few plugins. Logic is working better but still not great.

## Seriously unhappy with my imac M1 (2020-12-26)
 My new imac crash once or twice a day, becomes unresponsive etc. That's kernel crashes. I hope Apple will fix most of them in next version of Big Sur.

## Fixing xcodebuild (2020-12-26)
 On a new mac I never remember how to install xcode and command
 line. I ended up with an errorw which
 ```
 xcode-select --install
 sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
 sudo xcodebuild -license accept
 ```
 fixed.
