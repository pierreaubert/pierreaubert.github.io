# Spinorama

You are *probably* looking after the: [spinorama](https://www.spinorama.org/) gallery.

It is a collection of loudspeakers measurements. They can
help you to make an educated decision when you want to purchase a
speaker. Price and quality are very loosely related. I do not have 
specific recommendations but I would buy for myself:

### For a bookshelves or desk speaker:
- [JBL 306P](https://pierreaubert.github.io/spinorama/JBL%20306P%20Mark%20ii/ASR/index_asr.html)
  for a cheap and good one.
- [Kali IN-8](https://pierreaubert.github.io/spinorama/Kali%20IN-8/ASR/index_asr.html)
  with some more money.
- For cost no object, I would go for [Genelec 8341](https://pierreaubert.github.io/spinorama/Genelec%208341A/ASR/index_asr.html)

### Floorstanders or large speaker:

- In the US, I would likely buy a pair of Revel.
- In Europe, I baught larger Genelec (8361).
