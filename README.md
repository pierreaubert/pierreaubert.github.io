# Spinorama

You are *probably* looking after the: [spinorama](https://www.spinorama.org/) gallery.

It is a collection of loudspeakers measurements. They can
help you to make an educated decision when you want to purchase a
speaker. Price and quality are very loosely related. I do not have
specific recommendations but I would buy for myself:

## For a bookshelves or desk speaker:
- [JBL 306P](https://www.spinorama.org/speakers/JBL%20306P%20Mark%20ii/ASR/index_asr.html)
  for a cheap and good one.
- [Kali IN-8](https://www.spinorama.org/speakers/Kali%20IN-8/ErinsAudioCorner/index_eac.html)
  with some more money.
- For cost no object, I would go for [Genelec 8341](https://www.spinorama.org/speakers/Genelec%208341A/ASR/index_asr-vertical.html)

Any bookshelves at the top of this [list](https://www.spinorama.org/?quality=high&page=1&shape=bookshelves&power=active&sort=score) is outstanding.

## Floorstanders or large speaker:

- In the US, I would likely buy a pair of Revel.
- In Europe, I baught a pair of Genelec 8361A.

Any floorstanders at the top of this [list](https://www.spinorama.org/?quality=high&page=1&shape=floorstanders&sort=score) is outstanding.

## Brands

Some brands sell high quality speakers in a consistent manner: Gelenec, Kali, Neumann, KEF, Revel, Kii, Dutch &amp; Dutch, Ascend Acoustics, Buchardt Audio, etc
New brands are also doing outstanding speakers: Mesanovic, March Audio, GGNTK, AsciLab, MoFi or SunAudio, etc

Their is also a lot of crap out there, spend some time looking at [spinorama.org](https://spinorama.org) to get data and pointers to original reviews. It is worth having a look. Why buy a crappy one when you can have a better one for cheaper? There is enough choice among the good ones.
